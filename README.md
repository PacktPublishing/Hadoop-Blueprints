#Hadoop Blueprints
This is the code repository for [Hadoop Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hadoop-blueprints?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783980307), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 6 has Hive queries and which are embedded in the content. There is one  pen source library written by the author, 
which is committed to GitHub at https://github.com/deshpandetanmay/flink-opentsdb-sink

There is no code for chapter 8.

The code will look like the following:
```
#!/bin/bash
while [ true ]
do
echo 1 2 $RANDOM
sleep 1
done
```

Code and data samples have been provided for every chapter. We have used Hadoop version 2.7.x in this book. All the coding samples have been developed and tested on the stock (Apache Software Foundation) version of Hadoop and other tools. You can download these tools from the Apache Software Foundation website. In Chapter 2, A 360-Degree View of the Customer, we have used Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) 2.3. HDP 2.3 is a bundle of Hadoop and several other tools from the ecosystem in a convenient virtual machine image that can run on VirtualBox or VMWare. You can download this virtual image from the website of Hortonworks at http://hortonworks.com/downloads/#data-platform. Due to the fast-evolving nature of Hadoop and its ecosystem of tools, you might find that newer versions are available than the ones used in this book. The specific versions of the tools
needed for the examples have been mentioned in the chapters where they are first introduced.
